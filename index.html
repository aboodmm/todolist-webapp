		3D smiley is a fictitous person made up by the author of this webpage. Because the person who is writing this is woefully uncreative, 3D smiley does not have anything special about him, though it should be noted that he gives no hecks. He is a UCSC student who is taking only the easiest classes he can find (which means no computer science courses.) The classes he is taking for Winter 2018 are Breathing 101, Food Consumption 203, and the capstone course Sleep 365.
